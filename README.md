# DUT Test Chatbot Frontend

A web application frontend for a Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrating the feasibility of automating test procedures for Devices Under Test (DUT) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). This project aims to enable users to describe test procedures in natural language, which are then parsed and structured for automated execution.

## Problem Statement

Create a POC to demonstrate the feasibility of Nokiaâ€™s Test Procedure Automation using NLP/NLU (Natural Language Processing/Understanding).

## Theme

ML (NLP/NLU) Powered Test Procedure Automation

## Features

- **NLP-enabled Chatbot:** Interact with a chatbot to describe DUT test configurations in natural language.
- **Automated Parsing:** The chatbot parses user inputs and provides structured outputs for test automation.
- **Export Options:** Users can copy results or save them as JSON or DOCX files.
- **Step-by-step Demo:** Built-in demo page showing example inputs and instructions.
- **Responsive Design:** Modern UI for ease of use and accessibility.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** ReactJS, CSS
- **NLP/ML Backend (assumed via API):** Python, Jupyter, spaCy (NLP), scikit-learn (ML)
- **Other Libraries:** 
  - `file-saver` for exporting files
  - `docx` for generating DOCX outputs
  - `react-icons` for UI icons

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`  
  Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

- `npm test`  
  Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

- `npm run build`  
  Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

- `npm run eject`  
  **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

See the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) for more details.

## Usage

1. **Navigate to the chatbot.**
2. **Type your test configuration** in natural language (e.g. `Configure DUT with User Side VSI with VLAN 100 on Line1`).
3. **Get structured output** generated by the chatbot.
4. **Export or copy** the output as needed (clipboard, JSON, DOCX).

### Example Inputs

- `Configure DUT with User Side VSI with VLAN 100 on Line1`
- `Configure DUT with Network Side VSI with VLAN 200 on Uplink1`
- `NetworkVSI-1 Parent = Uplink1`
- `Forwarder = N:1`
- `Test Eqpt - Upstream`
- `Entity2 = User Side Traffic Eqpt`
- `NumPackets To Generate = 100`
- `Src MAC = 99:02:03:04:05:06`
- `Dst MAC = 98:0A:0B:0C:0D:0E`
- `VLAN = 100, PBIT =5`
- ...and more
